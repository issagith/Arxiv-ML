the norm of intermediate derivative $|f^{(k)}|$, when the bounds $|f| \le M_0$
and $|f^{(n)}| \le M_n$, for the norms of the function and of its higher
derivative, are given.
  Here, we consider the case of a finite interval, and when all the norms are
the max-norms. Our interest to that particular case is motivated by the fact
that there are good chances to add this case to a short list of
Landau--Kolmogorov inequalities where a complete solution exists, i.e., a
solution that covers all values of $n,k\in\N$ (and, for a finite interval, all
values of $\sigma = M_n/M_0$).
  The main guideline here is Karlin's conjecture that says that, for all
$n,k\in\N$ and all $\sigma>0$, the maximum of $|f^{(k)}|$ is attained by a
certain Chebyshev or Zolotarev spline. So far, it has been proved only for
small $n \ge 4$ with all $\sigma$, and for all $n$ with particular $\sigma =
\sigma_n$. Here, we prove Karlin's conjecture in several further subcases:
  1) all $n,k\in\N$ and all $0 < \sigma \le \sigma_n$
  2) all $n \in \N$, all $\sigma > 0$, with $k=1,2$

communication, every node is considered as a source node and sends its message
to every other node in the network. In this paper, an improved one-to-all
communication algorithm in higher dimensional EJ networks is presented. The
paper shows that the proposed algorithm achieves a lower average number of
steps to receiving the broadcasted message. In addition, since the links are
assumed to be half-duplex, the all-to-all broadcasting algorithm is divided

In order to reveal all symmetries of the particular D-brane Anti-D-brane

order $\alpha'$ corrections of fermionic couplings to tachyons, we employ all
the Conformal Field Theory (CFT) methods to a six point function. Basically, we
construct all the correlation functions of four spin operators and two world
sheet fermion fields. The S-matrix of two fermion fields, two real tachyons in
the presence of a closed string Ramond-Ramond (RR) field in type II will be
explored. Applying all the symmetries of the amplitude, a proper expansion for
D-brane Anti D-brane is also found out. Having carried out all the Effective
Field Theory (EFT) techniques, one would discover all order singularity

computation overhead. Sparsely activated models, usually in the form of Mixture
of Experts (MoE) architecture, have sub-linear scaling of computation cost with
model size, thus providing opportunities to train and serve a larger model at
lower cost than their dense counterparts. However, distributed MoE training and
inference is inefficient, mainly due to the interleaved all-to-all
communication during model computation. This paper makes two main
contributions. First, we systematically analyze all-to-all overhead in
distributed MoE and present the main causes for it to be the bottleneck in
training and inference, respectively. Second, we design and build Lina to
address the all-to-all bottleneck head-on. Lina opportunistically prioritizes
all-to-all over the concurrent allreduce whenever feasible using tensor
partitioning, so all-to-all and training step time is improved. Lina further
exploits the inherent pattern of expert selection to dynamically schedule
resources during inference, so that the transfer size and bandwidth of
all-to-all across devices are balanced amid the highly skewed expert popularity
in practice. Experiments on an A100 GPU testbed show that Lina reduces the
training step time by up to 1.73x and reduces the 95%ile inference time by an

extended baryon operators on anisotropic, quenched lattices can be used to
reliably extract the masses of 5 or more excited states in the nucleon channel.
All-to-all quark propagators are expected to be needed when studying these
excited states on light, dynamical configurations because contributions from
multi-particle states are expected to be significant. The dilution method is
used to approximate the all-to-all quark propagators. Low-lying eigenmodes can
also be used if necessary. For efficient computation of matrix elements of the
interpolating operators, the algorithms should exploit the fact that many
extended baryon operators can be obtained from the different linear
combinations of three-quark colour-singlet operators. The sparseness of the
diluted noise vectors also afford several computation simplifications. Some
preliminary results are presented for nucleon effective masses.",R. G. Edwards; G. T. Fleming; B. Joo; K. J. Juge; A. Lichtl; C. J. Morningstar; D. G. Richards; S. J. Wallace,,hep-lat

all ones on the dependent variable? It is shown that OLS averages the estimates
for the all zero (and all one) groups, which by definition have all slope
coefficients of zero, with the slope coefficients for the groups with a mix of

  Computation-Communication Overlapping",2024-04-30T10:17:21Z,2024-04-30T10:17:21Z,"The Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) technique plays a crucial role in expanding the
size of DNN model parameters. However, it faces the challenge of extended
all-to-all communication latency during the training process. Existing methods
attempt to mitigate this issue by overlapping all-to-all with expert
computation. Yet, these methods frequently fall short of achieving sufficient
overlap, consequently restricting the potential for performance enhancements.
In our study, we extend the scope of this challenge by considering overlap at
the broader training graph level. During the forward pass, we enable non-MoE
computations to overlap with all-to-all through careful partitioning and
pipelining. In the backward pass, we achieve overlap with all-to-all by
scheduling gradient weight computations. We implement these techniques in
Lancet, a system using compiler-based optimization to automatically enhance MoE
model training. Our extensive evaluation reveals that Lancet significantly
reduces the time devoted to non-overlapping communication, by as much as 77%.
Moreover, it achieves a notable end-to-end speedup of up to 1.3 times when

behaviors in neuronal networks. In particular, we consider neuronal network
dynamics on Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi (ER) networks, regular random (RR) networks, ring
lattices, and all-to-all networks. We solve analytically a neuronal network
model with stochastic binary-state neurons in all the network topologies,
except ring lattices. Given that apart from network structure, all four models
are equivalent, this allows us to understand the role of network structure in
neuronal network dynamics. Whilst ER and RR networks are characterized by
similar phase diagrams, we find strikingly different phase diagrams in the
all-to-all network. Neuronal network dynamics is not only different within
certain parameter ranges, but it also undergoes different bifurcations (with a
richer repertoire of bifurcations in ER and RR compared to all-to-all
networks). This suggests that local heterogeneity in the ratio between
excitation and inhibition plays a crucial role on emergent dynamics.
Furthermore, we also observe one subtle discrepancy between ER and RR networks,
namely ER networks undergo a neuronal activity jump at lower noise levels
compared to RR networks, presumably due to the degree heterogeneity in ER
networks that is absent in RR networks. Finally, a comparison between network
oscillations in RR networks and ring lattices shows the importance of
small-world properties in sustaining stable network oscillations.",Marinho A. Lopes; Alexander V. Goltsev,10.1103/PhysRevE.99.022303,q-bio.NC

stronger repulsive interaction in the $I=1$ channel than in the $I=0$. The
phase shifts obtained by solving the Schr\""{o}dinger equations with the
potentials qualitatively reproduce the energy dependence of the experimental
phase shifts, and have the similar behavior to the previous results from
lattice QCD without all-to-all propagators. Our study demonstrates that the

sufficiently large $n$. We prove that all cycles are $n$-monophilic for all
$n$; we give a complete characterization of 2-monophilic graphs (which turns
out to be similar to the characterization of 2-choosable graphs given by Erdos,

quadratic forms that represent all positive odd integers. Kaplansky considered
this problem for ternary forms, giving a list of 23 candidates, and proving
that 19 of those represent all positive odds. (Jagy later dealt with a 20th
candidate.) Assuming that the remaining three forms represent all positive
odds, we prove that an arbitrary, positive-definite quadratic form represents
all positive odds if and only if it represents the odd numbers from 1 up to
451. This result is analogous to Bhargava and Hanke's celebrated 290-theorem.
In addition, we prove that these three remaining ternaries represent all
positive odd integers, assuming the generalized Riemann hypothesis.
  This result is made possible by a new analytic method for bounding the cusp
constants of integer-valued quaternary quadratic forms $Q$ with fundamental
discriminant. This method is based on the analytic properties of Rankin-Selberg
$L$-functions, and we use it to prove that if $Q$ is a quaternary form with
fundamental discriminant, the largest locally represented integer $n$ for which
$Q(\vec{x}) = n$ has no integer solutions is $O(D^{2 + \epsilon})$.",Jeremy Rouse,,math.NT

measure that is non-monogamic for a multiparty quantum state, it is always
possible to find a monotonically increasing function of the measure that is
monogamous for the same state. The statement holds for all quantum states,
whether pure or mixed, in all finite dimensions and for an arbitrary number of

popular network structures. The two-terminal network reliability is a success
probability that the network is still functioning and can be calculated by
verifying the connectivity between two specific nodes, and is an effective and
popular technique for evaluating the performance of all types of networks. To
obtain complete information for a making better decisions, a multi-terminal
network reliability extends the two specific nodes to a specific node subset in
which all nodes are connected. In this study, a new algorithm called the
all-multiterminal BAT is proposed by revising the binary-addition-tree

performance in synthesizing vivid local style details. They typically use the

matched to all positions of style features. However, all-to-all attention tends
to generate distorted style patterns and has quadratic complexity, limiting the
effectiveness and efficiency of arbitrary style transfer. In this paper, we
propose a novel all-to-key attention mechanism -- each position of content
features is matched to stable key positions of style features -- that is more
in line with the characteristics of style transfer. Specifically, it integrates
two newly proposed attention forms: distributed and progressive attention.
Distributed attention assigns attention to key style representations that
depict the style distribution of local regions; Progressive attention pays
attention from coarse-grained regions to fine-grained key positions. The
resultant module, dubbed StyA2K, shows extraordinary performance in preserving
the semantic structure and rendering consistent style patterns. Qualitative and

universal gate set, in the sense that every permutation of $\{0,1\}^n$ can be
implemented as a composition of these gates. Since every bit operation that
does not use all of the bits performs an even permutation, we need to use at
least one auxiliary bit to perform every permutation, and it is known that one
bit is indeed enough. Without auxiliary bits, all even permutations can be
implemented. We generalize these results to non-binary logic: For any finite
set $A$, a finite gate set can generate all even permutations of $A^n$ for all
$n$, without any auxiliary symbols. This directly implies the previously
published result that a finite gate set can generate all permutations of $A^n$
when the cardinality of $A$ is odd, and that one auxiliary symbol is necessary
and sufficient to obtain all permutations when the cardinality of $A$ is even.
We also consider the conservative case, that is, those permutations of $A^n$
that preserve the weight of the input word. The weight is the vector that
records how many times each symbol occurs in the word or, more generally, the
image of the word under a fixed monoid homomorphism from $A^*$ to a commutative
monoid. It turns out that no finite conservative gate set can, for all $n$,
implement all conservative even permutations of $A^n$ without auxiliary bits.
But we provide a finite gate set that can implement all those conservative
permutations that are even within each weight class of $A^n$.",Tim Boykett; Jarkko Kari; Ville Salo,,cs.DM

ground set $X$, and wants all other packets in $X$. The users can exchange
their packets by broadcasting coded or uncoded packets over a lossless
broadcast channel, and monetary transactions are allowed between any pair of
users. We define the utility of each user as the sum of two sub-utility
functions: (i) the difference between the total payment received by the user
and the total transmission rate of the user, and (ii) the difference between
the total number of required packets by the user and the total payment made by
the user. A rate-vector and payment-matrix pair $(r,p)$ is said to stabilize
the grand coalition (i.e., the set of all users) if $(r,p)$ is Pareto optimal
over all minor coalitions (i.e., all proper subsets of users who collectively
know all packets in $X$). Our goal is to design a stabilizing rate-payment pair
with minimum total sum-rate and minimum total sum-payment for any given
instance of the problem. In this work, we propose two algorithms that find such
a solution. Moreover, we show that both algorithms maximize the sum of utility

communication primitive to reduce model parameters in distributed DNN training.
Most existing all-reduce algorithms are designed for traditional electrical
interconnect systems, which cannot meet the communication requirements for
distributed training of large DNNs due to the low data bandwidth of the
electrical interconnect systems. One of the promising alternatives for
electrical interconnect is optical interconnect, which can provide high
bandwidth, low transmission delay, and low power cost. We propose an efficient
scheme called WRHT (Wavelength Reused Hierarchical Tree) for implementing
all-reduce operation in optical interconnect systems. WRHT can take advantage
of WDM (Wavelength Division Multiplexing) to reduce the communication time of
distributed data-parallel DNN training. We further derive the required number
of wavelengths, the minimum number of communication steps, and the
communication time for the all-reduce operation on optical interconnect. The
constraint of insertion loss is also considered in our analysis. Simulation
results show that the communication time of all-reduce by WRHT is reduced by
80.81%, 64.36%, and 82.12%, respectively, compared with three traditional
all-reduce algorithms according to our simulation results of an optical

nonzero rate can be in distinct dynamical phases, with differing entanglement
properties. We introduce theoretical approaches to measurement-induced phase
transitions (MPT) and also to entanglement transitions in random tensor
networks. Many of our results are for ""all-to-all"" quantum circuits with
unitaries and measurements, in which any qubit can couple to any other, and
related settings where some of the complications of low-dimensional models are
reduced. We also propose field theory descriptions for spatially local systems
of any finite dimensionality. To build intuition, we first solve the simplest
""minimal cut"" toy model for entanglement dynamics in all-to-all circuits,
finding scaling forms and exponents within this approximation. We then show
that certain all-to-all measurement circuits allow exact results by exploiting
local tree-like structure in the circuit geometry. For this reason, we make a
detour to give general universal results for entanglement phase transitions
random tree tensor networks, making a connection with classical directed
polymers on a tree. We then compare these results with numerics in all-to-all
circuits, both for the MPT and for the simpler ""Forced Measurement Phase
Transition"" (FMPT). We characterize the two different phases in all-to-all
circuits using observables sensitive to the amount of information propagated
between initial and final time. We demonstrate signatures of the two phases
that can be understood from simple models. Finally we propose
Landau-Ginsburg-Wilson-like field theories for the MPT, the FMPT, and
entanglement transitions in random tensor networks. This analysis shows a
surprising difference between the MPT and the other cases. We discuss
measurement dynamics with additional structure (e.g. free-fermion structure),

$L$, whose Galois group of their normal closure over $F$ has certain
properties, it will hold that $E(L)_{tors}=E(F)_{tors}$ for all elliptic curves
$E$ defined over $F$.
  Our methods turn out to be particularly useful in studying the possible
torsion groups $E(K)_{tors}$, where $K$ is a number field and $E$ is a base
change of an elliptic curve defined over $\mathbb Q$. Suppose that $E$ is a
base change of an elliptic curve over $\mathbb Q$ for the remainder of the

curves $E$ defined over $\mathbb Q$ and all number fields $K$ of degree $d$,
where $d$ is not divisible by a prime $\leq 7$. Using this fact, we determine
all the possible torsion groups $E(K)_{tors}$ over number fields $K$ of prime

determine all the possible groups $E(K)_{tors}$, where $K$ is a quartic number

bridge} of $G$ is an edge whose removal breaks all $s$-$t$ paths of $G$ (and
thus appears in all $s$-$t$ paths). Computing all $s$-$t$ bridges of $G$ is a
basic graph problem, solvable in linear time.
  In this paper, we consider a natural generalisation of this problem, with the
notion of ""safety"" from bioinformatics. We say that a walk $W$ is \emph{safe}
with respect to a set $\mathcal{W}$ of $s$-$t$ walks, if $W$ is a subwalk of
all walks in $\mathcal{W}$. We start by considering the maximal safe walks when
$\mathcal{W}$ consists of: all $s$-$t$ paths, all $s$-$t$ trails, or all
$s$-$t$ walks of $G$. We show that the first two problems are immediate
linear-time generalisations of finding all $s$-$t$ bridges, while the third
problem is more involved. In particular, we show that there exists a compact
representation computable in linear time, that allows outputting all maximal
safe walks in time linear in their length.
  We further generalise these problems, by assuming that safety is defined only
with respect to a subset of \emph{visible} edges. Here we prove a dichotomy
between the $s$-$t$ paths and $s$-$t$ trails cases, and the $s$-$t$ walks case:
the former two are NP-hard, while the latter is solvable with the same
complexity as when all edges are visible. We also show that the same complexity
results hold for the analogous generalisations of \emph{$s$-$t$ articulation
points} (nodes appearing in all $s$-$t$ paths).
  We thus obtain the best possible results for natural ""safety""-generalisations
of these two fundamental graph problems. Moreover, our algorithms are simple
and do not employ any complex data structures, making them ideal for use in
practice.",Massimo Cairo; Shahbaz Khan; Romeo Rizzi; Sebastian Schmidt; Alexandru I. Tomescu,10.1007/s00453-021-00877-w,cs.DS

  Language Feedback",2024-12-20T12:27:16Z,2024-12-30T07:27:58Z,"Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has proven effective in
enhancing the instruction-following capabilities of large language models;
however, it remains underexplored in the cross-modality domain. As the number
of modalities increases, aligning all-modality models with human intentions --
such as instruction following -- becomes a pressing challenge. In this work, we
make the first attempt to fine-tune all-modality models (i.e. input and output
with any modality, also named any-to-any models) using human preference data
across all modalities (including text, image, audio, and video), ensuring its
behavior aligns with human intentions. This endeavor presents several
challenges. First, there is no large-scale all-modality human preference data
in existing open-source resources, as most datasets are limited to specific
modalities, predominantly text and image. Secondly, the effectiveness of binary
preferences in RLHF for post-training alignment in complex all-modality
scenarios remains an unexplored area. Finally, there is a lack of a systematic
framework to evaluate the capabilities of all-modality models, particularly
regarding modality selection and synergy. To address these challenges, we
propose the align-anything framework, which includes meticulously annotated
200k all-modality human preference data. Then, we introduce an alignment method
that learns from unified language feedback, effectively capturing complex
modality-specific human preferences and enhancing the model's
instruction-following capabilities. Furthermore, to assess performance
improvements in all-modality models after post-training alignment, we construct
a challenging all-modality capability evaluation framework -- eval-anything.

into the configuration interaction (CI) calculations. These correlations take
place in the core area where the potential of external electrons is
approximately constant. A constant potential does not change the core electron
wave functions and Green's functions. Therefore, all operators describing
interaction of $M$ valence electrons and $N-M$ core electrons (the core part of
the Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian
  $V^{N-M}$, the correlation potential $\hat\Sigma_1({\bf r},{\bf r'},E)$ and
the screening of interaction between valence electrons by the core electrons
$\hat\Sigma_2$) may be calculated with all
  $M$ valence electrons removed. This allows one to avoid subtraction diagrams
which make accurate inclusion of the core-valence correlations for $M>2$
prohibitively complicated. Then the CI Hamiltonian for $M$ valence electrons is
calculated using orbitals in complete $V^{N}$ potential (the mean field
produced by all electrons); $\hat\Sigma_1$ + $\hat\Sigma_2$ are added to the CI
Hamiltonian to account for the core-valence correlations. We calculate
$\hat\Sigma_1$ and $\hat\Sigma_2$ using many-body perturbation theory in which
dominating classes of diagrams are included in all orders.
  We use neutral Xe I and all positive ions up to Xe VIII as a testing ground.
We found that the core electron density for all these systems is practically
the same. Therefore, we use the same $\hat\Sigma_1$ and $\hat\Sigma_2$ to build
the CI Hamiltonian in all these systems ($M=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8$). Good agreement
with experiment for energy levels and Land\'{e} factors is demonstrated for all

this means to give the decomposition of the groupoid of all such structures in

Leibniz algebra structures on $E$ are classified by a global cohomological
object ${\mathbb G} {\mathbb H} {\mathbb L}^{2} \, (\mathfrak{L}, \,

governed by two opposing mechanisms: Vertices become occupied at rate $1$,
independently for all vertices. Independently thereof and independently for all
vertices, ""lightning"" hits vertices at rate $\lambda(n) > 0$. When a vertex is
hit by lightning, its occupied cluster instantaneously becomes vacant.
  Now suppose that $\lambda(n)$ decays exponentially in $n$ but much more
slowly than $1/|B_n|$. We show that then there exist a supercritical time
$\tau$ and $\epsilon > 0$ such that the forest-fire model on $B_n$ between time

magnetoresistance (MR) using microscale Hall bars. Two distinct magnetic
domains of the all-in-all-out spin structure are known to exhibit linear MR but
with opposite signs, which enables us to estimate the ratio of the two domains
in the patterned channel. The linear MR for 80 ${\times}$ 60 ${\mu}$m$^2$
channel is nearly zero after zero-field cooling, suggesting random distribution
of domains smaller than the channel size. In contrast, the wide distribution of
the value of the linear MR is detected in 2 ${\times}$ 2 ${\mu}$m$^2$ channel,
reflecting the detectable domain size depending on each cooling-cycle. Compared

universal gate set, in the sense that every permutation of $\{0,1\}^n$ can be
implemented as a composition of these gates. Since every bit operation that
does not use all of the bits performs an even permutation, we need to use at
least one auxiliary bit to perform every permutation, and it is known that one
bit is indeed enough. Without auxiliary bits, all even permutations can be
implemented. We generalize these results to non-binary logic: If $A$ is a
finite set of odd cardinality then a finite gate set can generate all
permutations of $A^n$ for all $n$, without any auxiliary symbols. If the
cardinality of $A$ is even then, by the same argument as above, only even
permutations of $A^n$ can be implemented for large $n$, and we show that indeed
all even permutations can be obtained from a finite universal gate set. We also
consider the conservative case, that is, those permutations of $A^n$ that
preserve the weight of the input word. The weight is the vector that records
how many times each symbol occurs in the word. It turns out that no finite
conservative gate set can, for all $n$, implement all conservative even
permutations of $A^n$ without auxiliary bits. But we provide a finite gate set
that can implement all those conservative permutations that are even within
each weight class of $A^n$.",Tim Boykett; Jarkko Kari; Ville Salo,,cs.ET

two major forms of leukemia that arise from lymphoid cells (LCs). ALL occurs
mostly in children and CLL occurs mainly in old people. However, the
Philadelphia-chromosome-positive ALL (Ph+-ALL) and the Ph-like ALL occur in
both children and adults. To understand childhood leukemia/lymphoma, we have
recently proposed two hypotheses on the causes and the mechanism of cell
transformation of a LC. Hypothesis A is: repeated bone-remodeling during
bone-growth and bone-repair may be a source of cell injuries of marrow cells
including hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), myeloid cells, and LCs. Hypothesis B
is: a LC may have three pathways on transformation: a slow, a rapid, and an
accelerated. We discuss in the present paper the developing mechanisms of ALL
and CLL by these hypotheses. Having a peak incidence in young children, ALL may
develop mainly as a result of rapid cell transformation of a lymphoblast (or
pro-lymphocyte). Differently, Ph+-ALL and Ph-like ALL may develop as results of
transformation of a lymphoblast via accelerated pathway. Occurring mainly in
adults, CLL may be a result of transformation of a memory B-cell via slow
pathway. By causing cell injuries of HSCs and LCs, repeated bone-remodeling
during bone-growth and bone-repair may be related to the cell transformation of
a LC. In conclusion, ALL may develop as a result of cell transformation of a
lymphoblast via rapid or accelerated pathway; and repeated bone-remodeling
during bone-growth may be a trigger for the cell transformation of a
lymphoblast in a child.",Jicun Wang-Michelitsch; Thomas M Michelitsch,,q-bio.CB

trajectory of $x$. In this paper, we concentrate on $(a_n )_{n\geqslant 1} $

to all infinite sequence $(a_n )_{n\geqslant 1} $ of positive integers and
consider all these generalized E-sequences. We then define $(a_n )_{n\geqslant
1} $ to be $\Omega-$convergent to $x$ if it is the E-sequence of $x$ and to be
$\Omega-$divergent if it is not the E-sequence of any odd positive integer. We
prove a remarkable fact that the $\Omega-$divergence of all non-periodic
E-sequences implies the periodicity of $(x_n )_{n\geqslant 0} $ for all $x_0$.

abstraction that models the peer-to-peer communication capabilities implemented
in most commodity smartphone operating systems. The capacity of a network
expresses how much sustained throughput can be maintained for a set of
communication demands, and is therefore a fundamental bound on the usefulness
of a network. Because of this importance, wireless network capacity has been
active area of research for the last two decades.
  The three capacity problems that we study differ in the structure of the
communication demands. The first problem is pairwise capacity, where the
demands are (source, destination) pairs. Pairwise capacity is one of the most
classical definitions, as it was analyzed in the seminal paper of Gupta and
Kumar on wireless network capacity. The second problem we study is broadcast
capacity, in which a single source must deliver packets to all other nodes in
the network. Finally, we turn our attention to all-to-all capacity, in which
all nodes must deliver packets to all other nodes. In all three of these
problems we characterize the optimal achievable throughput for any given
network, and design algorithms which asymptotically match this performance. We
also study these problems in networks generated randomly by a process
introduced by Gupta and Kumar, and fully characterize their achievable
throughput.
  Interestingly, the techniques that we develop for all-to-all capacity also
allow us to design a one-shot gossip algorithm that runs within a
polylogarithmic factor of optimal in every graph. This largely resolves an open
question from previous work on the one-shot gossip problem in this model.",Michael Dinitz; Magnús M. Halldórsson; Calvin Newport; Alex Weaver,10.4230/LIPIcs.DISC.2019.14,cs.DC

hadron systems which contain quark annihilation processes using all-to-all
quark propagators. We employ the hybrid method for all-to-all propagators,
which combines a low-mode spectral decomposition of the quark propagator and
stochastic estimators for remaining high modes, to evaluate the HAL QCD
potentials for the first time. Using this method, we investigate the $I= 1,2$
$\pi \pi$ scatterings at $m_{\pi} \approx 870$ MeV. In the $I=2$ study, we
study how statistical fluctuations of the HAL QCD potentials are increased due
to stochastic estimators in the hybrid method, compared with the conventional
one without them. We find that we can reduce statistical fluctuations by
dilutions of stochastic noises in order to obtain sufficiently precise results,
which turn out to be consistent with conventional results without all-to-all
propagators. In the $I=1$ $\pi \pi$ case, which contains quark annihilation
processes, we find that statistical fluctuations are further enhanced due to
noise contaminations in annihilation processes. We, however, confirm that we
can also reduce such statistical fluctuations to obtain the potential with a
reasonable precision as long as we further increase a degree of dilutions at a
price of large numerical costs and take an appropriate scheme for the
potential.",Yutaro Akahoshi; Sinya Aoki; Tatsumi Aoyama; Takaya Miyamoto; Kenji Sasaki,,hep-lat

the surreal numbers constitute a linearly ordered (proper) class $No$
containing the class of all ordinal numbers ($On$) that, working within the
background set theory NBG, can be defined by a recursion on the class $On$.
Since then, have appeared many constructions of this class and was isolated a
full axiomatization of this notion that been subject of interest due to large
number of interesting properties they have, including model-theoretic ones.
Such constructions suggests strong connections between the class $No$ of
surreal numbers and the classes of all sets and all ordinal numbers.
  In an attempt to codify the universe of sets directly within the surreal
number class, we have founded some clues that suggest that this class is not
suitable for this purpose. The present work, that expounds parts of the PhD
thesis of the first author (\cite{Ran18}), establishes a basis to obtain an
""algebraic (set) theory for surreal numbers"" along the lines of the Algebraic
Set Theory - a categorial set theory introduced in the 1990's based on the
concept of ZF-algebra: to establish abstract and general links between the
class of all surreal numbers and a universe of ""surreal sets"" similar to the
relations between the class of all ordinals ($On$) and the class of all sets

since they preserve the norm of the input vector signals. Typically, such
systems are represented and analyzed using their unitary-matrix valued
frequency domain characteristics, although obtaining rational realizations for
matrix all-pass systems enables compact representations and efficient
implementations. However, an approach to obtain matrix all-pass filters that
satisfy phase constraints at certain frequencies was hitherto unknown. In this
paper, we present an interpolation strategy to obtain a rational matrix-valued
transfer function from frequency domain constraints for discrete-time matrix
all-pass systems. Using an extension of the Subspace Nevanlinna Pick
Interpolation Problem (SNIP), we design a construction for discrete-time matrix
all-pass systems that satisfy the desired phase characteristics. An innovation
that enables this is the extension of the SNIP to the boundary case to obtain
efficient time-domain implementations of matrix all-pass filters as matrix
linear constant coefficient difference equations, facilitated by a rational
(realizable) matrix transfer function. We also show that the derivative of
matrix phase constraints, related to the group delay at the interpolating
points, can be optimized to control the all-pass transfer matrices at the
unspecified frequencies. Simulations show that the proposed technique for
unitary matrix filter design performs as well as traditional DFT based
interpolation approaches, including Geodesic interpolation and the popular

  Computation-Collective Operations",2023-05-11T16:20:51Z,2024-04-23T11:55:01Z,"In order to satisfy their ever increasing capacity and compute requirements,
machine learning models are distributed across multiple nodes using numerous
parallelism strategies. As a result, collective communications are often on the
critical path, and hiding their latency by overlapping kernel-granular
communication and computation is difficult due to the absence of independent
computation. In this work, we propose fusing computation with dependent
collective communication by leveraging GPUs' massive parallelism and
GPU-initiated communication. We have developed self-contained GPU kernels where
workgroups (WGs) immediately communicate their results to remote GPUs when they
complete their computation. Meanwhile, other WGs within the same kernel perform
overlapping computation, maintaining high ALU utilization.
  We demonstrate our approach by creating three prototype fused operators
(embedding + All-to-All, GEMV + AllReduce, and GEMM + All-to-All) to address
the pervasive communication overheads observed in DLRM, Transformers and MoE
model architectures. In order to demonstrate that our approach can be
integrated into ML frameworks for wide adoption in production environments, we
expose our fused operators as new PyTorch operators as well as extend the
Triton framework to enable them. Our evaluations show that our approach can
effectively overlap communication with computations, subsequently reducing
their combined execution time than the current collective library-based
approaches. Our scale-up GEMV + AllReduce and GEMM + All-to-All implementations
achieve up to 22% and 20% lower execution time, while our fused embedding +
All-to-All reduces execution time by 20% and 31% for intra-node and inter-node

becoming more prevalent. Integrating these data sets can be a way to solidify
findings and even to make new discoveries. However, integrating multi-omics
data sets is challenging. Typically, data sets are integrated by performing an
all-vs-all correlation analysis, where each feature of the first data set is
correlated to each feature of the second data set. However, all-vs-all
association testing produces unstructured results that are hard to interpret,
and involves potentially unnecessary hypothesis testing that reduces
statistical power due to false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment.
  Implementation: Here, we present the anansi framework, and accompanying R
package, as a way to improve upon all-vs-all association analysis. We take a
knowledge-based approach where external databases like KEGG are used to
constrain the all-vs-all association hypothesis space, only considering
pairwise associations that are a priori known to occur. This produces
structured results that are easier to interpret, and increases statistical
power by skipping unnecessary hypothesis tests. In this paper, we present the
anansi framework and demonstrate its application to learn metabolite-function
interactions in the context of host-microbe interactions. We further extend our
framework beyond pairwise association testing to differential association
testing, and show how anansi can be used to identify associations that differ
in strength or degree based on sample covariates such as case/control status.

  temperatures via Glauber dynamics",2023-05-22T17:11:37Z,2023-09-13T13:12:35Z,"We consider the performance of Glauber dynamics for the random cluster model
with real parameter $q>1$ and temperature $\beta>0$. Recent work by Helmuth,
Jenssen and Perkins detailed the ordered/disordered transition of the model on
random $\Delta$-regular graphs for all sufficiently large $q$ and obtained an
efficient sampling algorithm for all temperatures $\beta$ using cluster
expansion methods. Despite this major progress, the performance of natural
Markov chains, including Glauber dynamics, is not yet well understood on the
random regular graph, partly because of the non-local nature of the model
(especially at low temperatures) and partly because of severe bottleneck
phenomena that emerge in a window around the ordered/disordered transition.
  Nevertheless, it is widely conjectured that the bottleneck phenomena that
impede mixing from worst-case starting configurations can be avoided by
initialising the chain more judiciously. Our main result establishes this
conjecture for all sufficiently large $q$ (with respect to $\Delta$).
Specifically, we consider the mixing time of Glauber dynamics initialised from
the two extreme configurations, the all-in and all-out, and obtain a pair of
fast mixing bounds which cover all temperatures $\beta$, including in
particular the bottleneck window. Our result is inspired by the recent approach
of Gheissari and Sinclair for the Ising model who obtained a similar-flavoured
mixing-time bound on the random regular graph for sufficiently low
temperatures. To cover all temperatures in the RC model, we refine
appropriately the structural results of Helmuth, Jenssen and Perkins about the
ordered/disordered transition and show spatial mixing properties ""within the
phase"", which are then related to the evolution of the chain.",Andreas Galanis; Leslie Ann Goldberg; Paulina Smolarova,10.1017/S0963548324000403,math.PR

  Exact Triangle instances with few zero-weight $4$-cycles was considered by
Jin and Xu [STOC 2023], who used it as an intermediate problem to show $3$SUM
hardness of All-Edges Sparse Triangle with few $4$-cycles (independently
obtained by Abboud, Bringmann and Fischer [STOC 2023]), which is further used
to show $3$SUM hardness of a variety of problems, including $4$-Cycle
Enumeration, Offline Approximate Distance Oracle, Dynamic Approximate Shortest
Paths and All-Nodes Shortest Cycles. We provide a simple reduction from Exact
Triangle to Exact Triangle with few zero-weight $4$-cycles. Our new reduction
not only simplifies Jin and Xu's previous reduction, but also strengthens the
conditional lower bounds from being under the $3$SUM hypothesis to the even
more believable Exact Triangle hypothesis. As a result, all conditional lower
bounds shown by Jin and Xu [STOC 2023] and by Abboud, Bringmann and Fischer
[STOC 2023] using All-Edges Sparse Triangle with few $4$-cycles as an

space ($\mathbb{R}^2$) for a multi-agent system that is comprised of $N$
identical double integrator agents. It is assumed that each agent operates
under constrained control input (i.e., $|u_i(t)| \leq 1$ $\forall i = 1, \hdots
N$). Further, a fixed fuel budget is also assumed i.e., the total amount of
cumulative input that can be expended is limited by $\int_0^{t_f}|u(t)|dt \le
\beta$. First, the attainable set $\mathcal{A}(t,x_0,\beta)$ at time $t$, which
is the set of all states that an agent can attain starting from initial
conditions $x_0$ under the fuel budget constraints at time $t$ is computed for
every agent. This attainable set is a convex set for all $t\ge0$. Then the
minimum time to consensus is the minimum time $\bar{t}$ at which attainable
sets of all agents intersect, and the consensus point is the point of
intersection. A closed-form expression for the minimum time consensus point is
provided for the case of three agents. Then, using Helly's theorem, the
intersection will be non-empty at a time when all the $N \choose 3$ triplets of
agents have non-empty intersection. The computation of minimum time consensus
for all $N \choose 3$ triplets is performed independently and can be
distributed among all the $N$ agents. Finally, the overall minimum time to
consensus is given by the triplet that has the highest minimum time to
consensus. Further, the intersection of all the attainable sets of this triplet

the most common cancer in adults and children. Traditionally, leukemia is
diagnosed by analyzing blood and bone marrow smears under a microscope, with
additional cytochemical tests for confirmation. However, these methods are
expensive, time consuming, and highly dependent on expert knowledge. In recent
years, deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), has
provided advanced methods for classifying microscopic smear images, aiding in
the detection of leukemic cells. These approaches are quick, cost effective,
and not subject to human bias. However, most methods lack the ability to
quantify uncertainty, which could lead to critical misdiagnoses. In this
research, hybrid deep learning models (InceptionV3-GRU, EfficientNetB3-GRU,
MobileNetV2-GRU) were implemented to classify ALL. Bayesian optimization was
used to fine tune the model's hyperparameters and improve its performance.
Additionally, Deep Ensemble uncertainty quantification was applied to address
uncertainty during leukemia image classification. The proposed models were
trained on the publicly available datasets ALL-IDB1 and ALL-IDB2. Their results
were then aggregated at the score level using the sum rule. The parallel
architecture used in these models offers a high level of confidence in
differentiating between ALL and non-ALL cases. The proposed method achieved a
remarkable detection accuracy rate of 100% on the ALL-IDB1 dataset, 98.07% on

alleviate this issue by selectively activating relevant experts. Despite this,
MoE models are hindered by high communication overhead from all-to-all

constraint, and complications from heterogeneous GPU environments.
  This paper presents Aurora, which optimizes both model deployment and
all-to-all communication scheduling to address these challenges in MoE
inference. Aurora achieves minimal communication times by strategically
ordering token transmissions in all-to-all communications. It improves GPU
utilization by colocating experts from different models on the same device,
avoiding the limitations of synchronous all-to-all communication. We analyze
Aurora's optimization strategies theoretically across four common GPU cluster
settings: exclusive vs. colocated models on GPUs, and homogeneous vs.
heterogeneous GPUs. Aurora provides optimal solutions for three cases, and for
the remaining NP-hard scenario, it offers a polynomial-time sub-optimal
solution with only a 1.07x degradation from the optimal.
  Aurora is the first approach to minimize MoE inference time via optimal model
deployment and communication scheduling across various scenarios. Evaluations

  Simultaneously and Efficiently",2024-10-31T10:47:46Z,2024-10-31T10:47:46Z,"The concept of probabilistic values, such as Beta Shapley values and weighted
Banzhaf values, has gained recent attention in applications like feature
attribution and data valuation. However, exact computation of these values is
often exponentially expensive, necessitating approximation techniques. Prior
research has shown that the choice of probabilistic values significantly
impacts downstream performance, with no universally superior option.
Consequently, one may have to approximate multiple candidates and select the
best-performing one. Although there have been many efforts to develop efficient
estimators, none are intended to approximate all probabilistic values both
simultaneously and efficiently. In this work, we embark on the first
exploration of achieving this goal. Adhering to the principle of maximum sample
reuse, we propose a one-sample-fits-all framework parameterized by a sampling
vector to approximate intermediate terms that can be converted to any
probabilistic value without amplifying scalars. Leveraging the concept of $
(\epsilon, \delta) $-approximation, we theoretically identify a key formula
that effectively determines the convergence rate of our framework. By
optimizing the sampling vector using this formula, we obtain i) a one-for-all
estimator that achieves the currently best time complexity for all
probabilistic values on average, and ii) a faster generic estimator with the
sampling vector optimally tuned for each probabilistic value. Particularly, our
one-for-all estimator achieves the fastest convergence rate on Beta Shapley
values, including the well-known Shapley value, both theoretically and
empirically. Finally, we establish a connection between probabilistic values

that for a typical $n$-dimensional convex body of constant width $1$ (without
loss of generality), at almost all boundary points, in the sense of measure,
all curvatures are equal to $1$. (In contrast, note that a ball of width $1$

completely smooth at almost all times and connected components of the singular

coreference cluster and decide about all of them at once. This technique can
help to avoid losing precision and also in finding long-distance relations. The
presented paper is a report of an ongoing study on an idea which proposes a new
approach for coreference resolution which can resolve all coreference mentions
to a given mention in the document in one pass. This has been accomplished by
defining an embedding method for the position of all members of a coreference
cluster in a document and resolving all of them for a given mention. In the
proposed method, the BERT model has been used for encoding the documents and a
head network designed to capture the relations between the embedded tokens.
These are then converted to the proposed span position embedding matrix which
embeds the position of all coreference mentions in the document. We tested this
idea on CoNLL 2012 dataset and although the preliminary results from this
method do not quite meet the state-of-the-art results, they are promising and
they can capture features like long-distance relations better than the other

that its latency and energy are sensitive to the data to be written as well as
the content that is overwritten. We observe that overwriting unknown memory
content can incur significantly higher latency and energy compared to
overwriting known all-zeros or all-ones content. This is because all-zeros or
all-ones content is overwritten by programming the PCM cells only in one
direction, i.e., using either SET or RESET operations, not both. In this paper,
we propose data content aware PCM writes (DATACON), a new mechanism that
reduces the latency and energy of PCM writes by redirecting these requests to
overwrite memory locations containing all-zeros or all-ones. DATACON operates
in three steps. First, it estimates how much a PCM write access would benefit
from overwriting known content (e.g., all-zeros, or all-ones) by
comprehensively considering the number of set bits in the data to be written,
and the energy-latency trade-offs for SET and RESET operations in PCM. Second,
it translates the write address to a physical address within memory that
contains the best type of content to overwrite, and records this translation in
a table for future accesses. We exploit data access locality in workloads to
minimize the address translation overhead. Third, it re-initializes unused
memory locations with known all-zeros or all-ones content in a manner that does
not interfere with regular read and write accesses. DATACON overwrites unknown
content only when it is absolutely necessary to do so. We evaluate DATACON with
workloads from state-of-the-art machine learning applications, SPEC CPU2017,
and NAS Parallel Benchmarks. Results demonstrate that DATACON significantly
improves system performance and memory system energy consumption compared to
the best of performance-oriented state-of-the-art techniques.",Shihao Song; Anup Das; Onur Mutlu; Nagarajan Kandasamy,10.1145/3381898.3397210,cs.AR

if $x^{|G:H|} \in H$ for all $x \in G$. Exponential subgroups are a
generalization of normal (and subnormal) subgroups: all subnormal subgroups are
exponential, but not conversely. Sabatini proved that all subgroups of a finite
group $G$ are exponential if and only if $G$ is nilpotent. The purpose of this
paper is to explore what the analogues of a simple group and a solvable group
should be in relation to exponential subgroups. We say that an exponential
subgroup $H$ of $G$ is exp-trivial if either $H = G$ or the exponent of $G$,
${\rm exp}(G)$, divides $|G:H|$, and we say that a group $G$ is exp-simple if
all exponential subgroups of $G$ are exp-trivial. We classify finite exp-simple
groups by proving $G$ is exp-simple if and only if ${\rm exp}(G) = {\rm
exp}(G/N)$ for all proper normal subgroups $N$ of $G$, and we illustrate how
the class of exp-simple groups differs from the class of simple groups.
Furthermore, in an attempt to overcome the obstacle that prevents all subgroups
of a generic solvable group from being exponential, we say that a subgroup $H$
of $G$ is weakly exponential if, for all $x \in G$, there exists $g \in G$ such
that $x^{|G:H|} \in H^g$. If all subgroups of $G$ are weakly exponential, then
$G$ is wexp-solvable. We prove that all solvable groups are wexp-solvable and
almost all symmetric and alternating groups are not wexp-solvable. Finally, we
completely classify the groups ${\rm PSL}(2,q)$ that are wexp-solvable. We show
that if $\pi(n)$ denotes the number of primes less than $n$ and $w(n)$ denotes
the number of primes $p$ less than $n$ such that ${\rm PSL}(2,p)$ is

can construct networks. In order to highlight the basic principles of
distributed network construction we keep the model minimal in all respects. In
particular, we assume finite-state processes that all begin from the same
initial state and all execute the same protocol (i.e. the system is
homogeneous). Moreover, we assume pairwise interactions between the processes
that are scheduled by an adversary. The only constraint on the adversary
scheduler is that it must be fair. In order to allow processes to construct
networks, we let them activate and deactivate their pairwise connections. When
two processes interact, the protocol takes as input the states of the processes
and the state of the their connection and updates all of them. Initially all
connections are inactive and the goal is for the processes, after interacting
and activating/deactivating connections for a while, to end up with a desired
stable network. We give protocols (optimal in some cases) and lower bounds for
several basic network construction problems such as spanning line, spanning
ring, spanning star, and regular network. We provide proofs of correctness for
all of our protocols and analyze the expected time to convergence of most of
them under a uniform random scheduler that selects the next pair of interacting
processes uniformly at random from all such pairs. Finally, we prove several

done through the use of a high-order Fourier statistic called the bispectrum

statistic. We show how all objects display qualitatively similar biphase
trends. In particular all biphase amplitudes are found to be smaller than
$\pi/2$, suggesting that the flux distributions for all sources are positively
skewed on all observed timescales, consistent with the log-normal distributions
expected from the fluctuating accretion disk model. We also find that for all
objects the biphases are positive at frequencies where the corresponding power
spectral densities display their high frequency break. This suggests that the
noise-like flaring observed is rising more slowly than it is falling, and thus
not time-reversible. This observation is also consistent with the fluctuating
accretion disk model. Furthermore, we observe the same qualitative biphase
trends in all four objects, where the biphases display a distinct decrease at
frequencies below the high-frequency break in their respective power spectral
densities. This behaviour can also be observed in the time-skewness of all four
objects. As far as we are aware, there is no immediate explanation for the

experiments have shown the capability to switch the magnetization of magnetic
thin films using ultrashort polarized laser pulses. In 2007, it was first
observed that the magnetization switching for GdFeCo alloy thin films was
helicity-dependent and later helicity-independent switching was also
demonstrated on the same material. Recently, all-optical switching has also
been discovered for a much larger variety of magnetic materials (ferrimagnetic,
ferromagnetic films and granular nanostructures), where the theoretical models
explaining the switching in GdFeCo films do not appear to apply, thus
questioning the uniqueness of the microscopic origin of all-optical switching.
Here, we show that two different all-optical switching mechanisms can be
distinguished; a ""single pulse"" switching and a ""cumulative"" switching process

two-step mechanism; a heat-driven demagnetization followed by a

and direct relationship with generalization for deep models. This enables the
following concrete applications of the all-layer margin: 1) by analyzing the
all-layer margin, we obtain tighter generalization bounds for neural nets which
depend on Jacobian and hidden layer norms and remove the exponential dependency
on depth 2) our neural net results easily translate to the adversarially robust
setting, giving the first direct analysis of robust test error for deep
networks, and 3) we present a theoretically inspired training algorithm for
increasing the all-layer margin. Our algorithm improves both clean and
adversarially robust test performance over strong baselines in practice.",Colin Wei; Tengyu Ma,,cs.LG

arbitrary complex-valued linear transformations between an input (N_i) and

diffractive surface and use a matrix pseudoinverse-based method to determine
the complex-valued transmission coefficients of the diffractive
features/neurons to all-optically perform a desired/target linear
transformation. In addition to this data-free design approach, we also consider
a deep learning-based design method to optimize the transmission coefficients
of diffractive surfaces by using examples of input/output fields corresponding
to the target transformation. We compared the all-optical transformation errors

data-driven (deep learning-based) diffractive designs to all-optically perform
(i) arbitrarily-chosen complex-valued transformations including unitary,
nonunitary and noninvertible transforms, (ii) 2D discrete Fourier
transformation, (iii) arbitrary 2D permutation operations, and (iv) high-pass

spatially-engineered diffractive features/neurons is N_i x N_o or larger, both
design methods succeed in all-optical implementation of the target

forecast the location, time and magnitude of all future earthquakes using the
estimates of the background seismicity rate and the rates of future aftershocks

controlled pseudo-prospective experiments with different combination of three
target magnitude thresholds: 2.95, 3.95 or 4.95 and two forecasting time

excited or measured. In the present paper, we show that two other types of
nodes, which are defined by the local topology of the network, play an

generic identifiability. We have called these nodes dources and dinks. We show
that a network is generically identifiable only if, in addition to the above
mentioned conditions, all dources are excited and all dinks are measured. We

Complementing the hardness result for at least $4$ partitions, we show that for

Bicolorability is NP-complete for linear 3-uniform $k$-regular hypergraphs even

the early stages of protein structure evolution, less flexibility is preferred
in the medieval and recent stages. GLU is found to be the most flexible residue
while VAL recorded to have the least flexibility. General trends in decrement
of B-Factors conformed to the general trend in the order of emergence of
protein structural domains. Decrement of B-Factor is observed to be most
decisive (monotonic and uniform) for VAL, while evolution of CYS and LYS
flexibility is found to be most skewed. Barring CYS, flexibility of all the
residues is found to have increased during evolution of alpha by beta folds,
however flexibility of all the residues (barring CYS) is found to have
decreased during evolution of all beta folds. Only in alpha by beta folds the
tendency of preferring higher residue mobility could be observed, neither alpha
plus beta, nor all alpha nor all beta folds were found to support higher
residue-mobility. In all the structural classes, the effect of evolutionary
constraint on polar residues is found to follow an exactly identical trend as
that on hydrophobic residues, only the extent of these effects are found to be
different. Though protein size is found to be decreasing during evolution,
residue mobility of proteins belonging to ancient and old structural domains
showed strong positive dependency upon protein size, however for medieval and

convergence of appraisal networks to structural balance either diverge in
finite time, or could get stuck in jammed states, or converge to only complete
graphs. In this paper, we study the open problem how steady non-all-to-all
structural balance emerges via local dynamics of interpersonal appraisals. We
first compare two well-justified definitions of structural balance for general
non-all-to-all graphs, i.e., the triad-wise structural balance and the
two-faction structural balance, and thoroughly study their relations. Secondly,
based on three widely adopted sociological mechanisms: the symmetry mechanism,
the influence mechanism, and the homophily mechanism, we propose two simple
models of gossip-like appraisal dynamics, the symmetry-influence-homophily
(SIH) dynamics and the symmetry-influence-opinion-homophily (SIOH) dynamics. In
these models, the appraisal network starting from any initial condition almost
surely achieves non-all-to-all triad-wise and two-faction structural balance in
finite time respectively. Moreover, the SIOH dynamics capture the co-evolution
of interpersonal appraisals and individuals' opinions. Regarding the
theoretical contributions, we show that the equilibrium set of the SIH (SIOH
resp.) dynamics corresponds to the set of all the possible triad-wise
(two-faction resp.) structural balance configurations of the appraisal
networks. Moreover, we prove that, for any initial condition, the appraisal

communication (LOCC). Given a set of states $S$, if there is one state in $S$
that can be transformed by LOCC into all other states in $S$, then this state
is maximally entangled in $S$. It is a well-known result that the
$d$-dimensional Bell state is the maximally entangled state in the set of all
bipartite states of local dimension $d$. Since in practical applications noise
renders every state mixed, it is interesting to study whether sets of mixed
states of relevance enable the notion of a maximally entangled state. A natural
choice is the set of all states with the same spectrum. In fact, for any given
spectrum distribution on two-qubit states, previous work has shown that several
entanglement measures are all maximized by one particular state in this set.
This has led to consider the possibility that this family of states could be
the maximally entangled states in the set of all states with the same spectrum,
which should then maximize all entanglement measures. In this work I answer
this question in the negative: there are no maximally entangled states for a
fixed spectrum in general, i.e. for every possible choice of the spectrum. In
order to do so, I consider the case of rank-2 states and show that for
particular values of the eigenvalues there exists no state that can be
transformed to all other isospectral states not only under LOCC but also under
the larger class of non-entangling operations. This in particular implies that
in these cases the state that maximizes a given entanglement measure among all
states with the same spectrum depends on the choice of entanglement measure,
i.e. it cannot be that the aforementioned family of states maximizes all
entanglement measures.",Julio I. de Vicente,10.1103/PhysRevLett.133.050202,quant-ph

The general lack of a detection of a supernova component at larger redshifts

infinite multiplicity. We describe all compactly supported eigenfunctions with

Riemann surface. On each sheet, the Lyapunov function has the same properties
as in the scalar case, but it has branch points, which we call resonances. We
prove that all resonances are real. We determine the asymptotics of the
periodic and anti-periodic spectrum and of the resonances at high energy. We
show that there exist two types of gaps: i) stable gaps, where the endpoints
are periodic and anti-periodic eigenvalues, ii) unstable (resonance) gaps,
where the endpoints are resonances (i.e., real branch points of the Lyapunov
function). We obtain the following results from the inverse spectral theory: 1)
we describe all finite gap potentials, 2) the mapping: potential -- all

function of discriminating and encoding incident light signals according to

ranges are differentiated and endowed with different logic state encodings.
Compared with values previously reported, the operating bandwidth is enlarged

eccentricity, since a decrease in perigee of only 5-10% would cause them to
crash. However, these satellites are subject to gravitational perturbations
from the Earth's multipole moments, the Moon, and the Sun that are not
spherically symmetric and hence do not conserve angular momentum, especially
over the tens of thousands of orbits made by a typical satellite. Why then do
satellites not crash? We describe a vector-based analysis of the long-term
behavior of satellite orbits and apply this to several toy systems containing a
single non-Keplerian perturbing potential. If only the quadrupole potential
from the Earth's equatorial bulge is present, all near-circular orbits are
stable. If only the octupole potential is present, all such orbits are
unstable. If only the lunar or solar potential is present, all near-circular
orbits with inclinations to the ecliptic exceeding 39 degrees are unstable. We
describe the behavior of satellites in the simultaneous presence of all of
these perturbations and show that almost all low Earth orbits are stable
because of an accidental property of the dominant quadrupole potential. We also
relate these results to the phenomenon of Lidov-Kozai oscillations.",Scott Tremaine; Tomer Yavetz,10.1119/1.4874853,astro-ph.EP

graphs are generalised split graphs, together with a method to generate such
graphs almost uniformly.
  We show that the distribution of the maximum of the stability number
$\alpha(P_n)$ and clique number $\omega(P_n)$ is close to a concentrated
distribution $L(n)$ which plays an important role in our generation method. We
also prove that the probability that $P_n$ contains any given graph $H$ as an
induced subgraph is asymptotically $0$ or $\frac12$ or $1$. Further we show
that almost all perfect graphs are $2$-clique-colourable, improving a result of
Bacs\'o et al from 2004; they are almost all Hamiltonian; they almost all have
connectivity $\kappa(P_n)$ equal to their minimum degree; they are almost all
in class one (edge-colourable using $\Delta$ colours, where $\Delta$ is the
maximum degree); and a sequence of independently and uniformly sampled perfect
graphs of increasing size converges almost surely to the graphon $W_P(x, y) =
\frac12(\mathbb{1}[x \le 1/2] + \mathbb{1}[y \le 1/2])$.",Colin McDiarmid; Nikola Yolov,,math.CO

overcomes significant limitations in minimal obtainable gate length and
gate-length control in previous horizontal wrap-gated nanowire transistors that
arise because the gate is defined by wet etching. In the method presented here
gate-length control is limited by the resolution of the
electron-beam-lithography process. We demonstrate the versatility of our
approach by fabricating a device with an independent bottom gate, top gate, and
gate-all-around structure as well as a device with three independent
gate-all-around structures with 300 nm, 200 nm, and 150 nm gate length. Our

perturbation. This decomposition is unique and, moreover, the set of all
possible split functions has a very simple structure, while the set of all
perturbations forms a linear space and is therefore very easy to describe in
terms of its basis. We show how this approach allows to find all

that all agents must use to make decisions in this quasi-simultaneous game
setting. According to the protocol, agents first select an intended action
using a behavioral profile. Then, the protocol defines whether an agent has
precedence to take its intended action or must take a sub-optimal action. The
protocol ensures safety under all traffic conditions and liveness for all
agents under `sparse' traffic conditions. We provide proofs of correctness of
the protocol and validate our results in simulation.",Karena X. Cai; Tung Phan-Minh; Soon-Jo Chung; Richard M. Murray,,cs.MA

Floquet-Lindblad theory, we identify the control field that can effectively
turn on/off the input signal whose amplitude envelope is a square-wave (SW)

the AOPSs controlled by a continuous-wave (CW) field and an SW control field,

the strong discordance (for nonlocal correlation beyond that achievable by a
strictly classical state), discordance (a measure of all nonlocal correlation
in distinguishably quantum states), and diagonal discordance (for nonlocal
correlation in diagonal states), all of which are exactly computable for all

metasurfaces, supporting both electric and magnetic Mie-type resonances in
their nanostructures, have appeared as a promising alternative to nonlinear
plasmonics. High-index dielectric nanostructures, allowing additional magnetic
resonances, can induce magnetic nonlinear effects, which along with electric
nonlinearities increase the nonlinear conversion efficiency. In addition, low
dissipative losses and high damage thresholds provide an extra degree of
freedom for operating at high pump intensities, resulting in a considerable
enhancement of the nonlinear processes. In this review, we discuss the current
state-of-the-art in the intensely developing area of all-dielectric nonlinear

semigroup FI(X) weakly generated by |X| idempotents such that all other regular
semigroups weakly generated by |X| idempotents are homomorphic images of FI(X).
The semigroup FI(X) is defined by a presentation $\langle
G(X),\rho_e\cup\rho_s\rangle$ and its structure is studied. Although each of
the sets $G(X)$, $\rho_e$, and $\rho_s$ is infinite for $|X|\geq 2$, we show
that the word problem is decidable as each congruence class has a canonical
form. If $FI_n$ denotes FI(X) for $|X|=n$, we prove also that $FI_2$ contains
copies of all $FI_n$ as subsemigroups. As a consequence, we conclude that (i)
all regular semigroups weakly generated by a finite set of idempotents, which

all high enough powers. In our main results we provide constructions and
explicit examples of monomial ideals all of whose powers have some
characteristic-dependent Betti numbers or whose asymptotic regularity depends
on the field. We prove that, adding a monomial on new variables to a monomial
ideal, allows to spread the characteristic dependence to all powers. For any
given prime $p$, this produces an edge ideal such that the Betti numbers of all
its powers over $\mathbb{Q}$ and over $\mathbb{Z}_p$ are different. Moreover,

many fascinating and challenging associated problems. Hex meshes vary in
complexity from structured to unstructured depending on application or domain
of interest. Fully structured meshes require that all interior mesh edges are
adjacent to exactly four hexes. Edges not satisfying this criteria are
considered singular and indicate an unstructured hex mesh. Singular edges join
together into singular curves that either form closed cycles, end on the mesh
boundary, or end at a singular node, a complex junction of more than two
singular curves. While all hex meshes with singularities are unstructured,
those with more complex singular nodes tend to have more distorted elements and
smaller scaled Jacobian values. In this work, we study the topology of singular
nodes. We show that all eight of the most common singular nodes are
decomposable into just singular curves. We further show that all singular
nodes, regardless of edge valence, are locally decomposable. Finally we
demonstrate these decompositions on hex meshes, thereby decreasing their

probabilities to a single label situation, where only one class is the correct
answer. The proposed classifier is confident only if a single class has a high
probability and other probabilities are negligible. Unlike the typical softmax
function, SLOVA naturally detects out-of-distribution samples if the
probabilities of all other classes are small. The model is additionally
fine-tuned with exponential calibration, which allows us to precisely align the
confidence score with model accuracy. We verify our approach on three tasks.
First, we demonstrate that SLOVA is competitive with the state-of-the-art on

existing randomized smoothing methods cannot provide optimal protection for all

received substantial interest of both fundamental and applied research due to
its unrivaled speed and broad bandwidth. Compared to its electronic
counterpart, photons seldom interact with each other which makes them obtain a
long coherence time on one hand and relieved from heavy energy dissipation on
the other. However, one of the hindrances to achieve all-optical circuits is
the large volume of all-optical devices to achieve specific functionalities. In
this work, we propose and demonstrate experimentally three meta-lenses for
differential imaging employing the framework of weak measurement: (1) partial
differential lens, (2) total differential lens and (3) second order
differential lens compatible with the requirement of miniaturization to achieve
all-optical technology. Based on Fresnel-lens-like structures, our meta-lenses
incorporated the previous weak-measurement compartment into wavelength scale,
which induces a miniature differential operation system as a result. In
addition to its potential importance in heavily integrated all-optical neural
networks, the differential lens can be easily incorporated in the existing
imaging systems like a conventional lens without increasing the complexity of
the system of interest.",Xiong Liu; Rongchun Ge; Xinrui Li; Jinglei Du; Hong Zhang; Zhiyou Zhang,,physics.optics

flat and highly degenerate. They can always be diagonalized by a finite
sequence of local unitary transformations parameterized by a set of angles

demonstrated that quasiperiodic perturbations of the one-dimensional
all-bands-flat lattice with \(\theta_{i} = \pi/4\) give rise to a
critical-to-insulator transition and fractality edges separating critical from
localized states. In this study we consider the full range of angles
\(\theta_{i}\)s available for the all-bands-flat model and study the effect of
the quasiperiodic perturbation. For weak perturbation, we derive an effective
Hamiltonian and we identify the sets of \(\theta_{i}\)s for which the effective
model maps to extended or off-diagonal Harper models and hosts critical states.
For all the other values of the angles the spectrum is localized. Upon
increasing the perturbation strength, the extended Harper model evolves into
the system with energy dependent critical-to-insulator transitions, that we dub
\emph{fractality edges}. The case where the effective model maps onto the

proposes an efficient Dynamic Reference Modeling paradigm (DRM-IR), which
consists of task-adaptive degradation modeling and model-based image restoring.
Specifically, these two subtasks are formalized as a pair of entangled
reference-based maximum a posteriori (MAP) inferences, which are optimized
synchronously in an unfolding-based manner. With the two cascaded subtasks,
DRM-IR first dynamically models the task-specific degradation based on a
reference image pair and further restores the image with the collected
degradation statistics. Besides, to bridge the semantic gap between the
reference and target degraded images, we further devise a Degradation Prior
Transmitter (DPT) that restrains the instance-specific feature differences.
DRM-IR explicitly provides superior flexibility for All-in-One IR while being
interpretable. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that

resource-demand feasibility, implying that at all iterations of the scheduling
algorithm, the balance between the produced power and demand plus reserved
power must hold. The other concern is to design algorithms to tolerate
communication time-delays and changes in the network. Further, one can
incorporate possible model nonlinearity in the algorithm to address both
inherent (e.g., saturation and quantization) and purposefully-added (e.g.,
signum-based) nonlinearities in the model. The proposed optimal allocation
algorithm addresses all the above concerns, while it benefits from possible

providing convenient online marketplaces for individual sellers and buyers.
However, sellers in these systems may not fully disclose the information of

Sellers' strategic information disclosure significantly affects buyers' user
experiences and systems' reputation. This paper presents the first analytical
study on information disclosure and pricing of competing sellers in sharing
systems. In particular, we propose a two-stage game framework to capture
sellers' strategic behaviors and buyers' decisions. Although the optimization
problem is challenging due to sellers' non-convex and non-monotonic objectives,
we completely characterize the complex market equilibria by decomposing it into
several tractable subproblems. We demonstrate that full disclosure by all
sellers or non-disclosure by all sellers will both lead to intense price
competition. The former all-disclosure case is never an equilibrium even when
all sellers have good commodity qualities and low privacy costs, while the
latter non-disclosure case can be an equilibrium under which all sellers get
zero profit. We also reveal several critical factors that affect sellers'
information disclosure. Interestingly, sellers' sharing capacity limitation and
buyers' estimation biases encourage information disclosure as they mitigate
sellers' competition.",Ningning Ding; Zhixuan Fang; Jianwei Huang,,cs.GT

a case-by-case basis. This approach hinders the exploration of all possible
variants, thereby limiting the benefits derived from architectural diversity.
By employing a generalized analytical approach through the reciprocal screw
method, we systematically explore all the kinematic conditions for limbs
yielding $SO(3)$ motion.Consequently, all 73 possible types of non-redundant
limbs suitable for generating the target $SO(3)$ motion are identified. The
approach involves performing an in-depth algebraic motion-constraint analysis
and identifying common characteristics among different variants. This leads us
to systematically explore all 73 symmetric and 5256 asymmetric variants, which
in turn become a total of 5329, each potentially having different workspace
capability, stiffness performance, and dynamics. Hence, having all these

To mitigate these issues, we propose a method to take selfies with multiple

complements undetected ones considering the consistency across all frames.
After performing facial expression recognition on all the frames, the proposed

multiparameter twisted Weyl algebras, for which we parametrize all simple
quotients of a certain kind. Both Jordan's simple localization of the
multiparameter quantized Weyl algebra and Hayashi's q-analog of the Weyl
algebra are special cases of this construction. We classify all simple weight
modules over any multiparameter twisted Weyl algebra. Extending results by
Benkart and Ondrus, we also describe all Whittaker pairs up to isomorphism over
a class of twisted generalized Weyl algebras which includes the multiparameter
twisted Weyl algebras.",Vyacheslav Futorny; Jonas T. Hartwig,10.1016/j.jalgebra.2011.11.004,math.QA

systems generated by diffeomorphisms of closed smooth manifolds. We show that
the $C^1$-interior of the set of all diffeomorphisms having so-called inverse
periodic shadowing property coincides with the set of $\Omega$-stable
diffeomorphisms. The equivalence of Lipschitz inverse periodic shadowing
property and hyperbolicity of the closure of all periodic points is proved.
Besides, we prove that the set of all diffeomorphisms that have Lipschitz
inverse periodic shadowing property and whose periodic points are dense in the
nonwandering set coincides with the set of Axiom A diffeomorphisms.",Alexey V. Osipov,,math.DS
